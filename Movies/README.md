# Filmi

## Description

Site is getting the data from an open API and sorting it by popular, you can view more information about each movie that is done by sending the movie_id to GET correct JSON through the API. You can also add the movie to favorites which are stored on Google App Engine.

Page is live on: https://filmi-aljazkosirnik.appspot.com/

## Built With

* [TMDb](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) - The Movie Database (TMDb) API
* [GAE](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) - Google App Engine
* [Colors](https://colorhunt.co/palette/13712) - Colors used in project are from colorhunt.co
* HTML5, CSS3 Flexbox & also to make it dynamic I used rem units and viewport height/width instead of px
* Python WebApp2

## Todo

* ~~Make it responsive for all devices~~
* Stop using GAE and switch to SQL DB for accounts and data of users
* Make a login page for users to make their own account and have their own popular selection (right now its site-wide)
* ~~Make a filter that can not only sort movies by popular, new, trendy but also for TV shows~~
