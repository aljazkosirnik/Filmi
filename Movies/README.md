## Todo

* ~~Make it responsive for all devices~~
* Stop using GAE and switch to SQL DB for accounts and data of users
* Make a login page for users to make their own account and have their own popular selection (right now its site-wide)
* ~~Make a filter that can not only sort movies by popular, new, trendy but also for TV shows~~
